.. attention:: The SR-Pro Camera was discontinued and replaced with the 3D-Depth Camera. The depth camera acts as a normal camera when plugged in via USB. Depth features and more are coming soon. For those not using the WPILib framework, an SDK is available here for depth features: `SDK <https://www.orbbec.com/developers/orbbec-sdk/>`__
